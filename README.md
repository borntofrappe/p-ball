Going back to **Pokémon Pinball** for the **Game Boy Color** I struggled to get over the initial learning curve

- collecting even one entry in the red version, a huge achievement thanks to a Bellsprout always out of reach

- going full circle for one evolution, under the pressure of time and one last item you just cannot fetch

Never mind reaching a different area to find a new set of creatures. And yet, despite all these issues there was growth and sweet victories:

- discovering how to trigger a bonus more frequently

- learning the angle of the right paddle to hit the Poliwag bumper with pinpoint precision

Now, you may find it difficult to reap the rewards behind the first investment. You may need a push to play ball. Hence, this web app to tilt you in the right direction. 

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

You can look for a **Pokémon** to learn how to find the creature.  You can look for an **area** to preview the creatures which you might see — and catch. The rest is up to you, to play long enough to fill in the gaps and the pages of the digital encyclopedia.

**Bonus stage**: discover the **catch of the day**.
